## Tasks to Complete

### Literature Review
The general process of finding and analyzing papers and sites dedicated to similar purposes.

**Month of Completion: September 2024**

- Gather, summarize, and cite relevant research papers and studies to this project.
- Analyze comparable websites to find trends in frontend design, tech stack, and functionality.
- Outline findings in a centralized location for use in development and later during the thesis.

### Frontend Design
The process of determining the visual and interactive elements of the website based on research.

**Month of Completion: September 2024**

- Determine general styling for the site based on preliminary research.
- Draft Figma designs for frontend styling and associated details (logo, animations, etc.).
- Adhere to modern and aesthetically pleasing design choices.

### Codebase Setup
The initial process of ensuring that all components of the tech stack have been implemented in a working manner.

**Month of Completion: October 2024**

- Containerize all systems independently to adhere to the microservices model.
- Implement and connect the chosen DBMS with the ORM for connectivity between the backend and database.
- Set up external frontend pages (homepage, navigation, login, registration).
- Set up backend routes (e.g., authentication) to ensure cross-container connectivity.

### Building MVP Prototype
Completing all necessary tasks to have a working site for general functionality.

**Month of Completion: December 2024**

- Implement all pages and routes needed to have a working prototype.
- No implementation of LLM or additional features at this point.

### Unit Testing
Designing tests for site features as they are implemented.

**Month of Completion: February 2024**

- Design tests for frontend pages and components.
- Design tests for backend routes and APIs.

### LLM Integration
Incorporating an open-source large language model (LLM) into the working prototype.

**Month of Completion: January 2024**

- Decide on an LLM to use in the final product.
- Establish connectivity between the site and the chosen LLM.

### Testing Site Functionality
Allowing other students to test the site and report on desired features or changes.

**Month of Completion: February 2024**

- Reach out to students and allow general testing of site functionality.
- Collect responses about the usability and user interface of the site.

### Final Feature Implementation
Adding the last features necessary to have a complete prototype for the site.

**Month of Completion: February 2024**

- Implement nice-to-have features.
- Make the changes and additions recommended by the testing demographic.

### Deployment
Hosting the site at a designated domain.

**Month of Completion: February 2024**

- Deploy all containers for the site to a hosting service.
- Connect a domain to the hosted site.

### Thesis
Producing a final report consisting of background research and details about the site and development process.

**Month of Completion: March 2024**

- Use the sources first analyzed in the literature review.
- Write an extensive paper detailing the site, its features, and the development process.

### Presentation
Giving a final report and demo of the site during the presentation.

**Month of Completion: April 2024**

- Design a PowerPoint for the presentation.
- Ensure the site is set up to perform a comprehensive demo.
- Deliver the presentation.

## Timeline by Months

### September 2024 - Research and Frontend Design
During this month, the literature review will be conducted, and frontend design decisions will be made. The aim is to research existing technologies and trends in design to inform the project's foundation.

### October 2024 - Codebase Setup
This month involves setting up the codebase, including containerization, database connectivity, and preliminary frontend and backend setup.

### December 2024 - Building MVP Prototype
In December, the minimum viable product (MVP) of the website will be built, ensuring the basic features are functional, without integrating advanced or optional features yet.

### January 2025 - LLM Integration and Final Touches
The open-source large language model (LLM) will be integrated into the project in January, completing the final structure of the MVP.

### February 2025 - Unit Testing, User Testing, and Final Feature Implementation
This month will focus on unit testing and user testing to ensure the functionality and usability of the website. Final features will also be implemented.

### March 2025 - Thesis Writing
The thesis will be written in March, detailing the entire development process, background research, and evaluation of the project.

### April 2025 - Presentation Preparation
In April, the focus will be on preparing the final presentation, including creating slides and performing a demo of the website.
