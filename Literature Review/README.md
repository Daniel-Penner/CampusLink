# Analysis of Similar Websites

## Website 1: Discord 

Discord is currently among the most widely used social media platforms for students and is utilized both for collaboratively tackling academic projects and for fostering community, making it an excellent place to draw inspiration from.

### Styling/Design Choices:
- **Dark Mode as Default**: Dark mode reduces eye strain to make the site usable for long periods. Additionally, it provides a sense of minimalism and a modern look.
- **Dark Blues and Greys for Styling**: Despite being predominantly grey, Discord's background has a subtle blue tint to prevent it from feeling too monochrome and give it a pop of colour.
- **Minimalist UI**: By reducing clutter and unnecessary information on-screen, users can easily navigate and determine the functionality of each tool. 
- **Rouned Edges**: Rounded corners in web design are often associated with a sense of safety, approachability, and friendliness, which may help Discord more easily provide a sense of community to its users.

### Programming Choices:
- **React Frontend**: Provides a dynamic, modern, and responsive user interface. An industry standard across most modern interface-focused platforms.
- **Electron Framework**: By using the electron framework for desktop application design, the site design can feel very universal both on the web and as an app.
- **WebSocket API**: Allows for instantaneous real-time messaging and calls to provide a better sense of interpersonal connection between users.

### Navigation Choices:
- **Channel-Based Navigation**: Users can easily manage multiple simultaneous conversations without being overwhelmed by separating communication into multiple layers {servers -> channels -> threads}.
- **Hotkeys**: Keyboard shortcuts make navigation even more efficient for experienced users.

## Website 2: Slack

The biggest competitor to Discord and another site that fills the same general niche. Slack is a very prominent site for academic correspondence.

### Styling/Design Choices:
- **Clean and Professional Design**: A simple, professional design that makes it an obvious choice for business communication, but also makes use for casual users very manageable.
- **Custom Themes**: Allows users to customize the colours of their workspace. This may reduce the cohesion of the colour palette based on what the user chooses, but it offers freedom and adaptability.

### Programming Choices:
- **React Frontend**: Provides a dynamic, modern, and responsive user interface. An industry standard across most modern interface-focused platforms.
- **Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTM)**: Ensures real-time updates and communication between users, to allow for effective professional communication.
- **Slackbot for Help**: An AI helper is integrated into the site to improve usability and control.

### Navigation Choices:
- **Channel-Based Navigation**: Like Discord, Slack uses channels and threads to divide communication in a way that is manageable to users.
- **Search Functionality**: A powerful search feature to allow users to navigate even more easily across all past communications.

## 3. LinkedIn

The primary web application worldwide for professional networking. Allows users to easily find and make connections, and employers to reach out to users based on profiles that detail skills and job experience.

### Styling/Design Choices:
- **Professional Aesthetic**: Clean, professional, and safe design made up of a simple colour palette and avoiding abrasive or experimental design choices. 
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Displays profile, connections, and job opportunities with a distinct visual hierarchy.
- **Customizable Profiles**: Users can control how much information they provide to others. Plenty of information allows them to make very personalized connections, but they can also opt to share very little if they wish to prioritize privacy.

### Programming Choices:
- **React Frontend**: As the industry standard for clean and effective site design, LinkedIn, like Discord and Slack, has adopted React.
- **GraphQL API**: Given the massive amount of data LinkedIn works with, this API allows for that information to be efficiently transformed into manageable graphs and charts.
- **Microservices Architecture**: LinkedInâ€™s platform uses microservices to make scaling more manageable and handle the high traffic it encounters.

### Navigation Choices:
- **Profile-Centric Navigation**: LinkedIn's design is profile-centered. making it easy for anyone to see your information and posts, and for you to seek out others.
- **Search Filters**: Users can filter for certain attributes when searching for jobs or other users.
- **Activity Feed**: Users are prevented with an active feed that is managed for them by an algorithm within the platform.

## 4. Instagram
Despite being unrelated to academics, Instagram is a huge social media platform that is widely used by students. 

### Styling/Design Choices:
- **Visual-First Layout**: Emphasizes large images and videos, ensuring that visual content is the focal point.
- **Story & Reels Layout**: Separate sections for Stories and Reels encourage engagement with short-form content.
- **Minimalist Interface**: Reduces distractions and focuses on content, enhancing the browsing experience.

### Programming Choices:
- **React Native**: Used to build the mobile app, ensuring a consistent experience across Android and iOS platforms.
- **GraphQL API**: Allows efficient data queries to manage Instagram's heavy reliance on images and videos.
- **Machine Learning for Feed**: Uses machine learning to personalize the feed based on user behaviour and preferences, and implements AI-powered search features.

### Navigation Choices:
- **Bottom Tab Navigation**: Simple and intuitive navigation bar at the bottom for easy access to key sections (Home, Search, Profile).
- **Infinite Scrolling**: Keeps users engaged with a continuous feed of content, reducing the need to click through pages.
- **Stories & Reels**: Quick access to ephemeral content at the top of the feed keeps users interacting with time-sensitive content.
